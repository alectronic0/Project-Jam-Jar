Hi am Alec from Alectronic. and I am here today to talkabout Jam Jar.

Jam Jar is an online E-commrce platform for local farmers market produce. To sell to Customer and local restraunts and Shops (In Bulk).

The problem with Market stalls are they are static... In both Time & Location.
So they dratically reduce there market size.

Jam Jar solves this by putting your business online and running 24/7 and allow customer to order and pre-order your stock to either be picked up at the market or delivied to there door creating convince for both customers and marketstall owners.

But we also think it important that you business still has the same effect as the farmers market so we also will add to the Minium VIable Product a profile page for your prdocut so customer who they buying from with more feature to be added in later devlopment.

From my market anylisi about 200 Thousand people would use this product in sydneyl alone. with a estimated revune per sale of $3.64 in a year Jam Jar could earn 3.7M Times that by the world it goes up 1000x to 3.3Billion.

This all asumptions but my belif is that a trend will come from this with the convince of ordering online and the wants to support local business that this will gradual grow over time.

my force projection also indicsate that if the lanuch is successful that we could break even by the end of the year. this is not taking into account pre-launch cost.

Now once the lanuch has been successful Jam Jar can look toward the next phase which is getting the customer to become not only the consumer by also the grower for the local farms markets.
